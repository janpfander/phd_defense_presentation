According to the deficit model, if trust in science is rational, its main driver should be knowledge and understanding of science.

## Two basic cognitive mechanisms

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1 style="font-size:1.5em;"}
1. People infer competence from possessing rare knowledge. [But while the impression of competence persists, people forget the specific knowledge [Chapter 3]]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}

2. People infer accuracy from consensus [Chapter 4]

Version A

[(less impressive)]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}

[Archaeology is the science that studies human history and prehistory based on the analysis of objects from the past such as human bones, engravings, constructions, and various objects, from nails to bits of pots. This task requires a great deal of carefulness, because objects from the past need to often be dug out from the ground and patiently cleaned, without destroying them in the process. <br> Archaeologists have been able to shed light on human history in all continents, from ancient Egypt to the Incas in Peru or the Khmers in Cambodia. <br> Archaeologists study the paintings made by our ancestors, such as those that can be found in Lascaux, a set of caves found in the south of France that have been decorated by people at least 30000 years ago.]{.fragment .fade-out fragment-index="1"} <br> Archaeologists have also found remains of our more distant ancestors, showing that our species is just one among several that appeared, and then either changed or went extinct, such as Neanderthals, Homo erectus, or Homo habilis.

:::

::: {.column .center-right width="50%" style="font-size:20px;"}

Version B

[(more impressive)]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}

[Archaeologists, scientists who study human history and prehistory, are able to tell, from their bones, whether someone was male or female, how old they were, and whether they suffered from a range of diseases. Archaeologists can now tell at what age someone, dead for tens of thousands of years, stopped drinking their mother’s milk, from the composition of their teeth. <br> Archaeologists learn about the language that our ancestors or cousins might have had. For instance, the nerve that is used to control breathing is larger in humans than in apes, plausibly because we need more fine-grained control of our breathing in order to speak. <br> As a result, the canal containing that nerve is larger in humans than in apes – and it is also enlarged in Neanderthals.]{.fragment .fade-out fragment-index="1"} <br> Archaeologists can also tell, from an analysis of the tools they made, that most Neanderthals were right-handed. It’s thought that handedness is related to the evolution of language, another piece of evidence suggesting that Neanderthals likely possessed a form of language.

## Main results

::: {.big-center}

::: {.fragment}
When people read impressive scientific information, their trust in science increased
:::

::: {.fragment}
They then immediately forgot most of the content. 
:::

:::

::: {.notes}
Not just any content, but content that likely was important in generating the impression.

Maybe the knowledge that participants forget is not relevant for the impression. 

Two arguments against this: 

1. We also asked participants after the task to pick impressive information bits. Even among the subset of impressive bits (specific to each participant), they still forgot content 

2. In a validation study, we gave the recalled text to another set of participants. They rated them as less impressive than the original text. 

(if participants had retained all impressive information, and only strip down all the unimportant stuff, we would have predicted no difference).

# General discussion

---

## {.big-center}

Most people trust science at least to some extent.

. . .

Yet, they don’t understand or know much about science.

---

## {.big-center}

The rational impression account:

. . .

When exposed to science (mostly during education) people rationally develop a positive impression of science–in particular of the competence of scientists--by

. . .

- inferring competence from possessing rare knowledge

. . .

- inferring accuracy from consensus

. . .

However, they forget most of the information that gave rise to this impression.

---

## {.big-center}

This aligns with normative accounts, which suggest that science is trustworthy because of convergent results from multiple sources and methods <span style="font-size: 50%;">[@cartwrightTangleScienceReliability2022; @oreskesWhyTrustScience2019]</span>

# Limitations

---

## {.big-center}

The rational impression account explains trust--*not distrust*

. . .

Even people who trust most scientific knowledge can still distrust science on specific instances for many reasons

---

## {.big-center}

For example, because some knowledge is perceived as particularly inconvenient 

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1 .fade-in-then-out style="font-size:30px;"}
*(e.g., knowledge of climate change which would urge us to change our behavior)*
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
Or because it is rejected by other authorities–political, religious–people trust
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3 .fade-in-then-out style="font-size:30px;"}
*(e.g., the rejection of evolution among many religious communities)*
:::

---

## {.big-center}

Just because there is a rational explanation for trust, distrust does not need to be irrational.

. . .

Some groups have been systematically neglected or ill-treated by science, e.g. African Americans. <span style="font-size: 50%;">[@brandtRacismResearchCase1978; @scharffMoreTuskegeeUnderstanding2010]</span> 

. . .

Even if people believe scientists are competent, people might believe that they don't have their best interest at heart.

# Implications

---

## {.big-center}

Science communication should not stress consensus and impressiveness at all costs

. . .

Transparency about uncertainty is crucial for a lasting trust relationship between science and the public <span style="font-size: 50%;">[@druckmanCommunicatingPolicyRelevantScience2015; @petersenTransparentCommunicationNegative2021]</span>

. . .

Intellectual humility has been shown to increase trust in scientists <span style="font-size: 50%;">[@koetkeEffectSeeingScientists2024]</span>

---

## {.big-center}

Ultimately, doing better science will foster trust in science

. . .

People value open-science practices <span style="font-size: 50%;">[@songTrustingShouldersOpen2022]</span>

. . .

These practices will lead to more robust and consensual scientific findings
