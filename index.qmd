A lack of trust in science entails social or individual cost.

For example, if we don't trust climate scientists, this will have (and to some extent already has) disastrous consequences.

Similarly, not trusting vaccines puts both ourselves and others at serious health risk.

# The rational impression account of trust in science

A cognitive model of how people come to trust science
:::

---

## Two basic cognitive mechanisms

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1 style="font-size:1.5em;"}
::: {.fragment .highlight-red fragment-index=6}
1. People infer competence from possessing rare knowledge. [But while the impression of competence persists, people forget the specific knowledge [Chapter 3]]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}
:::
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3 .fade-in-then-out style="font-size:30px;"}
*For example, if a colleague at work fixes our computer, we might remember that she is competent, but not exactly how she fixed it.*
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=4 style="font-size:1.5em;"}
2. People infer accuracy from consensus [Chapter 4]
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=5 .fade-in-then-out style="font-size:30px;"}
*For example, if we have to pick between two restaurants we don't know, but everyone we ask says that Restaurant A is better, we'll believe it is indeed better*
:::

::: {.notes}
In the example with our colleague, we can evaluate that they are right, because we can see with our own eyes that our computer works after their fix. 

But in the case of science, we cannot observe or interpret most of the results ourselves.

So how do we know that scientists are right?

This had an impact on their trust in the scientific discipline and their perceptions of the scientists' competence...

Participants who read the more impressive texts reported larger increases in trust in the discipline (e.g., entomology)...

## Main results

::: {.big-center}

::: {.fragment}
When people read impressive scientific information, their trust in the scientific discipline increases
:::

::: {.fragment}
They then immediately forget most of the content. 
:::

:::

::: {.notes}
Not just any content, but content that likely was important in generating the impression.

Maybe the knowledge that participants forget is not relevant for the impression. 

Two arguments against this: 

1. We also asked participants after the task to pick impressive information bits. Even among the subset of impressive bits (specific to each participant), they still forgot content 

2. In a validation study, we gave the recalled text to another set of participants. They rated them as less impressive than the original text. 

(if participants had retained all impressive information, and only strip down all the unimportant stuff, we would have predicted no difference).

But...

---

## {.big-center}

The vast majority of the studies relied on a hand full of fact-checked items (Snopes, PolitiFact etc.) selected by the researchers.

. . .

Only in 3 papers, the researchers automatically scraped news...

---

![](meta_news_judgement/output/figures/forest-automated.png){width="70%"}

---

## {.big-center}

Even assuming that people are slightly more gullible than skeptical...

. . .

- people consume very little information in general 

. . .

- among this information, the share of misinformation very small

---

## {.big-center}

For example... 

- In the U.S., misinformation represents 1% of the news consumption and 0.15% of Americans’ daily media diet <span style="font-size: 50%;">[@allenEvaluatingFakeNews2020a]</span>.

. . .

- In France, misinformation represents 5% of the news consumption and 0.16% of people’s connected time <span style="font-size: 50%;">[@cordonierHowFrenchInform2021]</span>.

::: {.notes}
Using these base rates of information consumption, people being skeptical might be the more important issue
:::

---

## Conclusion

::: {.big-center}

Misinformation (especially coming from elites) is a problem.

::: {.fragment}
But people *not* believing true information might be the more pressing problem.
:::

# General discussion

---

## {.big-center}

Most people trust science at least to some extent.

. . .

Yet, they don’t understand or know much about science.

---

## {.big-center}

The rational impression account:

. . .

When exposed to science (mostly during education) people rationally develop a positive impression of science–in particular of the competence of scientists--by

. . .

- inferring competence from possessing rare knowledge

. . .

- inferring accuracy from consensus

. . .

However, they forget most of the information that gave rise to this impression.

---

## {.big-center}

This aligns with normative accounts, which suggest that science is trustworthy because of convergent results from multiple sources and methods <span style="font-size: 50%;">[@cartwrightTangleScienceReliability2022; @oreskesWhyTrustScience2019]</span>

# Limitations

---

## {.big-center}

The rational impression account explains trust--*not distrust*

. . .

Even people who trust most scientific knowledge can still distrust science on specific instances for many reasons

---

## {.big-center}

For example, because some knowledge is perceived as particularly inconvenient 

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1 .fade-in-then-out style="font-size:30px;"}
*(e.g., knowledge of climate change which would urge us to change our behavior)*
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
Or because it is rejected by other authorities–political, religious–people trust
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3 .fade-in-then-out style="font-size:30px;"}
*(e.g., the rejection of evolution among many religious communities)*
:::

Just because there is a rational explanation for trust, distrust does not need to be irrational.

## {.big-center}

For example, some groups have been systematically neglected or ill-treated by science, e.g. African Americans. <span style="font-size: 50%;">[@brandtRacismResearchCase1978; @scharffMoreTuskegeeUnderstanding2010]</span> 

. . .

Even if people believe scientists are competent, the might have reason to suspect that scientists don't have their best interest at heart.

The rational impression account is only a micro-level explanation.

. . .

It should be seen as complementary with macro-level (historical, sociological or political) explanations of trust in science.

# Implications

## {.big-center}

Science communication fosters trust in science.

. . .

Education has a positive impact even if it does not result in long-term memory of scientific facts or in an in-depth understanding of science.

## {.big-center}

But...

---

## {.big-center}

Science communication should *not* stress consensus and impressiveness at all costs

. . .

- Transparency about uncertainty is crucial for a lasting trust relationship between science and the public <span style="font-size: 50%;">[@druckmanCommunicatingPolicyRelevantScience2015; @petersenTransparentCommunicationNegative2021]</span>

. . .

- Intellectual humility has been shown to increase trust in scientists <span style="font-size: 50%;">[@koetkeEffectSeeingScientists2024]</span>

---

## {.big-center}

Ultimately, doing better science will foster trust in science

. . .

- People value open-science practices <span style="font-size: 50%;">[@songTrustingShouldersOpen2022]</span>

. . .

- These practices will lead to more robust and consensual scientific findings

Version A

[(less impressive)]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}

[Archaeology is the science that studies human history and prehistory based on the analysis of objects from the past such as human bones, engravings, constructions, and various objects, from nails to bits of pots. This task requires a great deal of carefulness, because objects from the past need to often be dug out from the ground and patiently cleaned, without destroying them in the process. <br> Archaeologists have been able to shed light on human history in all continents, from ancient Egypt to the Incas in Peru or the Khmers in Cambodia. <br> Archaeologists study the paintings made by our ancestors, such as those that can be found in Lascaux, a set of caves found in the south of France that have been decorated by people at least 30000 years ago.]{.fragment .fade-out fragment-index="1"} <br> Archaeologists have also found remains of our more distant ancestors, showing that our species is just one among several that appeared, and then either changed or went extinct, such as Neanderthals, Homo erectus, or Homo habilis.

Version B

[(more impressive)]{.fragment fragment-index="2"}

[Archaeologists, scientists who study human history and prehistory, are able to tell, from their bones, whether someone was male or female, how old they were, and whether they suffered from a range of diseases. Archaeologists can now tell at what age someone, dead for tens of thousands of years, stopped drinking their mother’s milk, from the composition of their teeth. <br> Archaeologists learn about the language that our ancestors or cousins might have had. For instance, the nerve that is used to control breathing is larger in humans than in apes, plausibly because we need more fine-grained control of our breathing in order to speak. <br> As a result, the canal containing that nerve is larger in humans than in apes – and it is also enlarged in Neanderthals.]{.fragment .fade-out fragment-index="1"} <br> Archaeologists can also tell, from an analysis of the tools they made, that most Neanderthals were right-handed. It’s thought that handedness is related to the evolution of language, another piece of evidence suggesting that Neanderthals likely possessed a form of language.
